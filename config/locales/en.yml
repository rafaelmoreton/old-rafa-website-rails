# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t "hello"
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t("hello") %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   "true": "foo"
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

  about-p1: "Hello, I'm Rafael Moreton. I've always been a technology enthusiast and recently found out my vocation in it. At the beginning of the pandemic, with jobs and classes paralysed, I decided to spend my time learning how to code, at first as a hobby - an old interest of mine which, until then, I hadn't dedicated much time to. That was when I realized how much this was capable of stimulating me. I discovered once more the satisfaction of inventing ways to approach a complex logical problem until I manage to solve it. I decided to make a career out of it when I realized that by developing pages and applications for the web I could combine my best abilities into a very fulfilling trade."
  about-p2: "When I was a mechanical technician, I developed an analytical and methodological eye for finding out the origin of mechanical failures; on the other hand, I felt repelled by the likelihood of permanent health damages caused by the insalubrity of factory work. As an actor, I discovered that creating collectively is invigorating for me. I learned to work with the variety of ideas that are naturally born from groups for furthering creative collaboration. Finally, working as a lighting technician, I could begin to put together my creative and logical knacks: to conceive lighting designs and make them into reality by applying technical knowledge."
  about-p3: "At the beginning of my self-learning journey I luckily found “The Odin Project”, an open-source curriculum created by developers to teach everything needed to become a full-stack developer. The assigned projects specify the requirements and give some brief instructions, very different from hand-holding tutorials, because the students are asked to find out their own solutions. That's how I earned the confidence and mindset to solve any problem that might arise during development - by finding ways for breaking it into smaller parts, looking for solutions to similar problems and studying the documentation of the tech-stack."
  about-p4: "After many hours stuck at problems and finding a way out; making hundreds of mistakes from which I learned something more, I feel that I'm ready to be challenged by bigger problems. I believe that every industry can find new solutions through technology and that the best way for me to keep improving is by contributing to this."
